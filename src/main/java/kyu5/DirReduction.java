// Directions Reduction

// â€¦ a man was given directions to go from one point to another.
// The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.
// Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction right away is a needless effort.
// Since this is the wild west, with dreadfull weather and not much water,
// it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!
// How I crossed a mountainous desert the smart way.
// Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings
// with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).
